IHOP, more lovingly called the Interdimensional Hole of Pancakes is a dimension that is all at once everything and nothing. It is the space between dimensions from which you can travel to all dimensions wrapped in a pancake by picking up the time knife and digging in.

The marvelous IHOP comes not from my imagination, but from the glorious late TV show, "The Good Place," RIP (https://www.nbc.com/the-good-place). This website is a companion to the show and much more enticing if you are familiar with the world. However, I hope the activities will intrinsically bring joy to those who have not seen the show. I do acknowledge that without watching the show, the website's meer existence will be confounding in the most ridiculous of ways...

Enjoy.
